# Final-Version
Final Project Source Code, Priority day planner 

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
TAM is an android application that is a day planner, week planner, and month planner. It keeps track of time and prioritizes more significant events to ensure enough time to be successful with all the events. It schedules the events for you to save time and ensure a healthy day with enough time for sleep, buffer time between events,study/training time, and exercise. 
<h2>Code Example</h2>
Create a login account, then enter your events, present and future. Once completed you can edit the events, or continue to view them in the customized schedule tab.
<h2>Motivation</h2>
With all the distractions in the world it is difficult to feel in control of your day. Whether you’re on your phone texting a friend, playing an application, thinking about loved ones, there are always thoughts on your mind. What am I doing next? What has to be done? How much time do I have leftover? Can I afford to sacrifice time in one place to replace it in another? Students are told early in their university careers to create a daily schedule. It is an amazing way to organize your day and understand what tasks need to be done. The problem with a schedule is it takes time to create and lacks a clear overall picture of your situation. Individuals don’t know how much free time they have, and other significant information. All this time adds up. It takes at least 15 minutes a day, and if you want to calculate other variables yourself it’s significantly more.  That’s 105 minutes a week, which could be spent elsewhere. Time is the most valuable resource so why don’t we take control of it, and value it to what it is actually worth.
